NAME

Apache::AuthzSplitDomainUser - mod_perl module for checking the htgroup file while
		       allowing you to split the DOMAIN\user, as sent forward by some winboxes


SYNOPSIS

    <Directory /foo/bar>
    # Optional Variables
    PerlSetVar groupFile /path/to/htgroups
    # Set the format of the username to check against
    # defaults to username
    PerlSetVar authzUsername username or domain\username

    PerlAuthzHandler Apache::AuthzSplitDomainUser

    # Standard require stuff, only user and 
    # valid-user work currently
    require valid-user

    # Optional, reqires that you have Apache::Htgroup
    # require group groupname
    </Directory>

    These directives can be used in a .htaccess file as well.

    If you wish to use your own PerlAuthzHandler then the require 
    directive should follow whatever handler you use.

DESCRIPTION

This module was written so that we could high-jack the Authz phase from Apache and 
modify values that are passed to the Authz Handler with perl.  The initial concept
was to deal with a problem that we are seeing from winXP boxes that are sending 
forward DOMAIN\username to Apache.  These obviously fail when checked against an
authentication, or authorization, scheme where the syntax is simply username. 

PerlSetVar groupFile

Set this to the path of the htgroup file you wish this module
to check in.  It allows you to specify your users in groups
found on the web server, as opposed to groups within Active 
Directory, etc. 

PerlSetVar authzUsername

Set this to "username" or "domain\username" depending on your preference.
(This simply formats the input username to allowing checking the username 
as "domain\username" or "username".)  For example:

# speeves is a DOMAIN user of DOMAIN
domain\username =>  DOMAIN\speeves 

# speeves is a DOMAIN user of DOMAIN,
# but the server administrator wants to
# check this user against groups in the 
# htgroup file as: 

# groupname: speeves userA userB

username => speeves

If you allow users to use B<Domain\Username> and restrict access
using the C<require user username> or C<require group groupname> make
sure to set the username with the domain included. The authorization 
phase will be looking for C<Domain\Username> string.

Example: require user mydomain\ramirezc

Note

This was shamelessly stolen from the authz method in Apache::AuthenSmb...
  
If you are using this module please let me know, I'm curious how many
people there are that need this type of functionality.
